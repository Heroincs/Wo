Child marriage violates children's rights and has many long-term consequences for both child brides and grooms. For child brides, in addition to mental health issues and lack of access to education and career opportunities,adverse health effects from early pregnancy and childbirth are common too. Effects on child grooms include being ill-prepared for certain responsibilities such as early fatherhood and providing for their families. Additional concerns include a lack of access to education, impaired decision-making power, and diminished career opportunities.
Child marriage is part of the practice of child betrothal, often including civil cohabitation and a court-approval of the engagement. Causes of child marriages include poverty, bride price, dowries, cultural traditions, religious and social pressures, regional customs, fear of the child remaining unmarried into adulthood, illiteracy, and the perceived inability of women to work for money.

Research indicates that comprehensive sex education can help to prevent child marriages. Rates of child marriages can also be significantly reduced by educating and strengthening rural communities in developing nations. Educated girls are equipped to make better life and marriage decisions, though the later not until adulthood. Rural development programs providing basic infrastructure, like healthcare, clean water, and sanitation, may aid families financially and, as such, further minimize child marriage.

    Pregnant teenagers face many of the same pregnancy-related issues as older women. There are additional concerns for those under the age of 15 as they are less likely to be physically developed to sustain a healthy pregnancy or to give birth.[8] For girls aged 15–19, risks are associated more with socioeconomic factors than with the biological effects of age.[9] Risks of low birth weight, premature labor, anemia, and pre-eclampsia are not connected to biological age by the time a girl is 16, as they are not observed in births to older teens after controlling for other risk factors, such as access to high-quality prenatal care.[10][11]

Teenage pregnancies are related to social issues, including lower educational levels and poverty.Teenage pregnancy in developed countries is usually outside of marriage and is often associated with a social stigma.Teenage pregnancy in developing countries often occurs within marriage and half are planned. However, in these societies, early pregnancy may combine with malnutrition and poor health care to cause medical problems. When used in combination, educational interventions and access to birth control can reduce unintended teenage pregnancies.
In 2023, about 41 females age per 1,000 had children between the ages of 15 and 19, as compared with roughly 65 births per 1000 in 2000.From 2015 to 2021, an estimated 14 percent of adolescent girls and young women globally reported giving birth before age 18. Rates have historically been higher in Africa and lower in Asia.In the developing world about 2.5 million females under the age of 16 and 16 million females 15 to 19 years old have children each year.Another 3.9 million have abortions. It is more common in rural than urban areas. Worldwide, complications related to pregnancy are the most common cause of death among females 15 to 19 years old.</p>

Education for girls means ensuring that they have the same access to education as boys. Its goal is to address gender inequality and enhance the quality of life for females. Education empowers girls, leading to better health, economic growth, and reduced poverty rates. Despite progress made in recent years, obstacles remain in India that impede girls' access to education.

Importance of Education for Girls
The Right to Education Act, 2009, guarantees all Indian girls the right to education as a fundamental right. This makes India the second most populated country in the world with 48.5% of female population. Providing education for girls aims at promoting gender parity that leads to prosperity.

Educated girls are likely to make informed decisions concerning child marriage, hygiene, nutrition, and sanitation. Enabling young women with life skills such as critical thinking prepares them for future workforce participation.
The importance of girl child education has become a fundamental right globally recognized by UNESCO as a human right. Despite India's progress in enrolment levels of primary school age girls within the last decade; many barriers remain that prevent secondary school enrolment resulting in an exclusion rate of out-of-school girls mostly from rural areas.
Governance plays a critical role in terms of access to educational opportunities; hence policies must ensure inclusion regardless of caste or ethnicity.
Providing financial support through CSR initiatives or central government-funded programs like Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme can encourage families from low-income backgrounds to prioritize their girl child's schooling.
Emerging evidence suggests that educating girls results in higher wages; hence educated women are likely to provide better nutrition, healthcare for their children leading to better outcomes reducing malnutrition rates within India.

          <font color="#137530"><font size="13px">Sexual abuse of girls</font size></font>
       <img src= "https://gumlet.assettype.com/greaterkashmir/2022-01/64f09803-9028-4287-8620-c98dd2644c8c/child_abuse.jpg?rect=0,0,800,450&auto=format,compress&fit=max&format=webp&w=576&dpr=1.0"   width="500"   height="350"  border="4">
      Child sexual abuse (CSA), also called child molestation, is a form of child abuse in which an adult or older adolescent uses a child for sexual stimulation. Forms of child sexual abuse include engaging in sexual activities with a child (whether by asking or pressuring, or by other means), indecent exposure (of the genitals, female nipples, etc.), child grooming, and child sexual exploitation,such as using a child to produce child pornography.

Child sexual abuse can occur in a variety of settings, including home, school, or work (in places where child labor is common). Child marriage is one of the main forms of child sexual abuse; UNICEF has stated that child marriage "represents perhaps the most prevalent form of sexual abuse and exploitation of girls". The effects of child sexual abuse can include depression,post-traumatic stress disorder,anxiety, complex post-traumatic stress disorder, propensity to further victimization in adulthood,and physical injury to the child, among other problems.Sexual abuse by a family member is a form of incest and can result in more serious and long-term psychological trauma, especially in the case of parental incest.

The global prevalence of child sexual abuse has been estimated at 19.7% for females and 7.9% for males.Most sexual abuse offenders are acquainted with their victims; approximately 30% are relatives of the child, most often brothers, fathers, uncles, or cousins; around 60% are other acquaintances, such as "friends" of the family, babysitters, or neighbors; strangers are the offenders in approximately 10% of child sexual abuse cases. Most child sexual abuse is committed by men; studies on female child molesters show that women commit 14% to 40% of offenses reported against boys and 6% of offenses reported against girls.
The word pedophile is commonly applied indiscriminately to anyone who sexually abuses a child,but child sexual offenders are not pedophiles unless they have a strong sexual interest in prepubescent children.Under the law, child sexual abuse is often used as an umbrella term describing criminal and civil offenses in which an adult engages in sexual activity with a minor or exploits a minor for the purpose of sexual gratification. The American Psychological Association states that "children cannot consent to sexual activity with adults", and condemns any such action by an adult: "An adult who engages in sexual activity with a child is performing a criminal and immoral act which never can be considered normal or socially acceptable behavior."

Global violence uniquely affects the girl child. Although international legal instruments have been in place for decades to protect the girl child, thousands of brutal acts of violence and neglect specifically targeting the girl child can be observed around the world on a daily basis. For centuries, girls who have barely attained adolescence have been forced into marriage, often with men many years their senior. As a minor, a girl child cannot legally give her consent to enter into such a partnership. They have suffered in female genital mutilation rituals. They are traded, bought, and sold across national borders as commodities to be put to use as prostitutes or slaves, or merely to be sold again at a profit. Many girls are even victimized before birth, as technology and greater access to medicine have given rise to prenatal sex selection and selection abortion based on sex. Girls continue to face the threat of sexual harassment and abuse in workplaces and schools. Their lives may be taken for the “honor” of their families for speaking to strangers or committing other minor transgressions. Violence against the girl child has become a powerful and all-too-common tactic in times of war and humanitarian disaster.
 
Violence against the girl child is perpetrated on every continent, wielded by every social and economic class, and sanctioned to varying degrees by every form of government, every major religion, and every kind of communal or familial structure. There is no place of complete refuge for the girl child, only promises of stronger legal regimes and more robust non-governmental assistance.</p>
